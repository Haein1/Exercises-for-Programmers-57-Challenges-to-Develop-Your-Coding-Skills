'''Create a tax calculator that handles multiple states and multiple counties within each state. The program prompts the user for the order amount and the state where the order will be shipped .

Eor Wisconsin resident, prompt for the county of residence 
For Eau Claire county residents, add an additional 0.005 tax 
For Dunn county residents, add an additional 0.004 tax 

Ilinois residents must be charged 8% sales tax with no additional county-level charge. All other states are not charged tax. The program then displays the tax and the total for Wisconsin and Illinois residents but just the total for everyone else.



Â Example Output 
What is the order amount? 10 
What state do you Live in? Wisconsin 
The tax is $0. 50.
The total is $10.50.
